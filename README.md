ACE -- AI Care for Elderly

## A lot of elderly people live alone in Hong Kong, espcecailly due to  ageing population. Hence, we want to create a better IoT and AI system to monitor the elderly, in case of an occurrence of a mishap. For example, if a lound bang or scream is heard, an alert is immediately sent to a social worker, who then follows up and contacts the elderly to check up on him. This can greatly reduce the health risks posed to the helpless elderly.
