### Background:
#### A lot of elderly people live alone in Hong Kong, espcecailly due to  ageing population. Hence, we want to create a better IoT and AI system to monitor the elderly, in case of an occurrence of a mishap. For example, if a lound bang or scream is heard, an alert is immediately sent to a social worker, who then follows up and contacts the elderly to check up on him. This can greatly reduce the health risks posed to the helpless elderly.

### Existing Solution
#### There are some systems used in elderly care homes, which detect movement of the eldery on the bed during the evening hours. However our solution is surrounding the elderly who live in public housing flats or private housing by themselves.



### Functions:  
Newspaper reading  
Bedwetting detection  
Falling Elderly    
Light system  
Automatic Door System  
Automatic Fan  
Turn on home appliances
